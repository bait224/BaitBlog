</time> Alexandre Lacazette faces disciplinary action from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Arsenal</a> after footage emerged that appeared to show him inhaling nitrous oxide from a balloon. The club are likely to take a strong line after assessing the images, which were reproduced in newspaper reports on Saturday. Lacazette is pictured with a balloon in his mouth and is quoted as sending text messages to friends saying he is â€œat home, chilling and doing balloonsâ€. A club spokesman said: â€œThis is a private matter which we are taking seriously. It will be handled internally.â€ This is not Lacazetteâ€™s first such incident and Arsenal will be exasperated at having to deal with a repeat. In August 2018 he was filmed inhaling gas in a nightclub along with his teammates Mesut Ã–zil, Matteo Guendouzi and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. When that video came to light four months later the players were spoken to by the club and reminded of their responsibilities. There will be further frustration that this is not Lacazetteâ€™s first misdemeanour during the Covid-19 shutdown. Last month he was reminded of his physical-distancing obligations after being pictured <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/arsenal-david-luiz-lacazette-pepe-and-xhaka-ignore-coronavirus-rules-physical-distancing"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">interacting with a valet who had visited his property to clean a car</a>. While that might be attributed to misunderstanding stipulations regarding essential services and home visits, none of these incidents are a good look for a player whose future has come into question during recent months. Lacazette admitted in February that his season has been â€œdifficultâ€ on a personal level, and before football was paused he lost his place up front to the academy graduate Eddie Nketiah. There have been suggestions that, in any case, he will be allowed to depart if Champions League football is not secured for the 2020-21 campaign. Arsenal have been training individually at their London Colney base over the past three weeks but aim to resume activities in small groups this week, if the Premier Leagueâ€™s protocols are approved on Monday."

The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/05/alexandre-lacazette-arsenal-lyon-olivier-giroud-france"" title="""" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">centre-forward who cost Â£52.7m</a> has two seasons remaining on his contract and there is not the same urgency to tie him down to a longer deal as there is in the case of â€“ among others â€“ Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. It has been suggested Lacazette and club are willing to part ways in the event of an unsuccessful season but the striker said on Wednesday he had no reason to depart. â€œI didnâ€™t know about this. I have a contract with the club, so there is no point to leave â€“ everybody is happy with me at the club.â€ Lacazette admitted this season had been â€œdifficultâ€ on a personal level, with the manager, Mikel Arteta, also saying the player has been â€œa little bit downâ€. Goals have arrived in irregular bursts, his recent effort against Newcastle ending a nine-game drought, and he has recently been kept out of the Premier League side by the academy product Eddie Nketiah. Lacazette is likely to start in the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Europa League</a> last-32 game against Olympiakos on Thursday and, having scored a late winner to decide the first leg in Piraeus, hopes he and his team have overcome the worst of a fraught season. â€œIn this moment we improve a lot, mentally and we can keep big confidence now,â€ he said. â€œI went through this and know I can be better now.â€ Arsenalâ€™s two senior strikers were the primary topics in the pre-match press conference and the briefing held by Arteta afterwards. Arteta had spoken extensively about Aubameyang after he scored twice in Sundayâ€™s 3-2 home win over Everton, saying he thinks the 30-year-old would like to stay. Aubameyangâ€™s figures in two years at Arsenal have been remarkable, bringing 60 goals in 95 games; the TV pundit Gary Neville has been among those to suggest his quality is underrated and Arteta agreed a centre-forwardâ€™s worth does not have to be measured in trophies. â€œHarry Kane has scored 30 goals and never won the Premier League,â€ he said, with a hint of mischief. â€œThere are a lot of good examples of players that do phenomenally but unfortunately there are a lot of top teams in this country and only one win the league. So you canâ€™t have everything in life. â€œWhat I can say with Aubameyang is that heâ€™s right there with the best of the scorers in this league. In the last 10 years if you look at his record and what heâ€™s done itâ€™s phenomenal. In my opinion heâ€™s up there with the best.â€ Arteta will name another strong side in an attempt to finish the job against Olympiakos, with consecutive Premier League wins not masking the fact Europa League success remains Arsenalâ€™s best chance of a return to the top table at this point. He will have to do without Sead Kolasinac, who was expecxted to see a specialist on Wednesday about the shoulder injury sustained against Newcastle. â€œItâ€™s a difficult area and we are not very positive about it,â€ he admitted. Bukayo Saka will probably start at left-back and Lacazette, sitting next to a manager who has attempted to calm the buzz around the 18-year-old, was effusive about his teammate. â€œI think heâ€™s maybe the best young player in the league,â€ he said. â€œHe needs to improve in a few things but you can see the quality he has and heâ€™s humble.â€ Support The Guardianâ€™s independent journalism by subscribing

First published on Sun 17 May 2020 <span class=""content__dateline-time"">16.17&nbsp;BST</span>
</time> Doctors have identified a group of blood compounds that may help to reveal which children are most at risk of developing a rare but life-threatening immune reaction to coronavirus. The new syndrome <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">emerged last month</a> after hospitals in London admitted a number of children to intensive care units with symptoms that resembled toxic shock mixed with an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">guidance on face masks</a> has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers â€“ not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b> â€œWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,â€ the WHO has stated. Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp; There is no robust scientific evidence â€“ in the form of trials â€“ that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces. Also underlying the WHOâ€™s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers. Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work.. <b>&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i> Hospitals around the world have since reported <a href=""https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/paediatric-inflammatory-multisystem-syndrome-and-sars-cov-2-rapid-risk-assessment"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">hundreds of similar cases</a> which many doctors believe are caused by the immune system overreacting to the virus sometimes weeks after infection. About 100 children in Britain have been treated for the disease with many being admitted with a persistent fever, skin rashes, abdominal pain and cold hands or feet. At least two children in the UK have died from the disorder, one of whom was an eight-month-old baby who passed away at Plymouthâ€™s Derriford hospital in April. Researchers at Imperial College London analysed blood from some of the sickest children and found they had high levels of five compounds that can be measured in routine tests. Two of the compounds, ferritin and C-reactive protein or CRP, are common blood markers for inflammation. The others are linked to heart damage and blood clotting, namely troponin, BNP and so-called â€œD-dimersâ€. â€œWe know that these markers are present in the very sick patients and at lower levels in some patients with normal Kawasaki disease,â€ said Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial. â€œWe think they can help us decide which children are at risk of progressing to cardiac failure. Essentially what weâ€™re doing is using the blood markers to try and pick out the children that we need to move from district hospitals to specialist centres and then to intensive care units if needed.â€ It will take more research to work out if the markers are reliable. If they are, doctors could potentially identify children most at risk from the condition with a simple blood test. To investigate further, the researchers have been granted permission from Englandâ€™s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, to recruit children into a European-funded trial called Diamonds that was already underway to study inflammatory disorders. Doctors around the UK and in multiple hospitals in Europe are now collecting blood samples for the study to learn which blood markers may help them predict the severity of disease and to understand the genetics of the disorder. â€œThis is a rapidly changing situation and we desperately need to learn how to manage it because we are now seeing quite significant numbers of children being admitted to district hospitals all over the place,â€ Levin said. â€œWhat we donâ€™t know when weâ€™re seeing a child for the first time, or hearing about them if theyâ€™re at another hospital, is which children are going to get better on their own and which are going to progress to having Kawasaki disease and are therefore at risk of getting coronary artery aneurysms, and who are the small number who will progress to multi-organ failure,â€ he added. The condition, named paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, resembles a mix of toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, the latter of which overwhelmingly affects children. The disease causes inflammation of the blood vessels and in some cases attacks the heart. The most serious complications are coronary aneurysms which can be fatal when they clot. Doctors typically intervene swiftly with anti-inflammatory drugs or immune-suppressing medicines. Doctors do not have time to run a formal trial to learn which treatments work best. Instead, plans have been drawn up for an international database that doctors will use to enter anonymous information on children in their care, including blood test results and what treatments are given when. â€œItâ€™s not as good as a randomized trial, but itâ€™s the next best thing in a pandemic. Because the numbers will be so big, it might give us a signal as to which treatments are best,â€ Levin said. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/health"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Health</a>, said it was too early to know how beneficial blood biomarkers might be for stratifying children with the new inflammatory disease.

</time> â€œThe political moment is nowâ€ to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade. Old passenger jets also need to be rapidly retired or cheap oil prices will encourage budget airlines to run services almost empty, which could push up emissions even if passenger numbers stay low, they say. As did banks after the 2008-9 financial crisis, many aviation companies are appealing for government support to escape from a problem they partly caused. The expansion of flight networks, packed seating and a reluctance to accept quarantine measures have contributed to the rapid transmission of the Covid-19 virus across the globe. Until the pandemic, governments were so focused on keeping airlines globally competitive that they largely gave the sector a free ride in terms of emissions cuts and contributions to public revenues. Aviation fuel is completely untaxed in most countries. But the crisis has weakened airline claims that they should be treated as profit-seeking independent companies rather than public entities with social responsibilities. Thousands of planes have been grounded for two months. Even if the lockdown is lifted soon, the industry expects revenues to halve this year. Many airlines are now begging for taxpayer support. European governments have agreed â‚¬12.7bn (Â£11.35bn) in bailouts, with another â‚¬17.1bn under discussion, according to a <a href=""https://carbonmarketwatch.org/our-work/aviation-emissions/aviation-bailout-tracker/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">tracker</a> compiled by Carbon Market Watch, Greenpeace and Transport &amp; Environment. The US approved $25bn (Â£20.6bn) support for the industry in April. If public funds are used to save companies, there is a growing argument that society should get something in return in terms of environmental improvements. Hopes were raised when the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Air France would have to become â€œthe greenest airline in the worldâ€ in return for a â‚¬7bn bailout. This meant reducing the carbon intensity of their overall operations by 50% by 2030, cutting absolute emissions within France by half by 2030, using 2% renewable jet fuel by 2024 and drastically reducing the number of flights of less than 2hr 30mins duration that compete with rail services. Although these conditions are currently non-binding, campaigners said they were hopeful they will be supported by new laws in the coming years. Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at the NGO Transport &amp; Environment, said this could be a turning point after decades of inaction. â€œBefore the Covid crisis, aviation emissions were going in the wrong direction. This is a moment that has shaken up the industry and raised questions about subsidies, tax breaks, and frequent flying. It is an opportunity for governments to think how they support the airline industry.â€ He said he was also encouraged the UK has not yet committed public funds to bail out airlines, which would gives them the incentive to put planes back in the sky too soon. A more important step, he said, would be for government to include aviation emissions in their climate targets. â€œItâ€™s not sexy, but itâ€™s very important,â€ he said. â€œWithout this, nationsâ€™ climate calculations are based on dodgy accounting, as Greta [Thunberg] <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/uks-creative-carbon-accounting-breaches-climate-deal-say-critics"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">pointed out</a> when she was in the UK last year.â€ Some environmentalists such as George Monbiot <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/airlines-oil-giants-government-economy"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">argue</a> airlines should not be rescued. This is echoed by Extinction Rebellion. â€œWith 90% of UK planes grounded, and knowing we need to halt polluting industries, there can be no justification for the government to financially support restarting flights. Letâ€™s embed this change rather than bail out this destructive industry and its tax-avoiding owners,â€ the groupâ€™s UK spokesperson Sarah Lunnon said. Other climate campaign organisations, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, say bailouts are only acceptable if they come with green conditions. They say airline companies should pay a fair share of taxes and not rely on offsets to reduce emissions, as they are currently doing. Among the measures they propose are fuel taxes on domestic flights (which are currently tax free) and the introduction of a frequent flier levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the worldâ€™s 7.6bn population flies frequently. â€œIf governments want to address the twin challenges of Covid and climate change, the political moment is now,â€ says Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. â€œPolicies to curb frequent flying could benefit both public health and the global environment.â€ He said passengers should also be given information about the carbon costs of their flights, which would allow them to support more efficient airlines. The difference between companies can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Even before the pandemic, the airline industry was feeling public pressure from â€œthe Greta effectâ€, direct action by Extinction Rebellion and the high court decision to block Heathrow expansion because it posed unacceptable climate risks. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK should build back better after the Covid-19 crisis. â€œThe government can accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation, by helping to scale up new energy sources, such as sustainable aviation fuels, just as they did successfully for solar and wind. Any company that is bailed out by the government should commit to net-zero emissions well before 2050.â€ Passenger numbers at the UKâ€™s largest airport fell by 97% in April, prompting hundreds of job losses and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/may/01/heathrow-boss-ba-redundancies-john-holland-kaye-safety-air-travel"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">fears of many more to follow</a>. British Airways and its parent company AIG did not respond to the Guardianâ€™s request for a comment about their willingness to accept tighter controls on emissions. The UK chancellor, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Rishi Sunak</a> has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-airlines-and-airports-told-not-to-expect-industry-wide-covid-19-bailout"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">said</a> he will not treat the aviation industry as a special case, but might consider bailouts on a case-by-case basis. Green party politicians say a clearer position is necessary to help workers in the sector to transition to other jobs. â€œWhilst a reduction in flying will have a tremendously positive impact on the environment, we need to ensure jobs are created elsewhere for those currently working in the aviation industry,â€ Brighton mayor Alex Phillips said. â€œThis could mean, for example, that workers are either offered the opportunity to retire in dignity or to retrain in new sectors â€“ whether they be in zero emission transport or low carbon jobs that we are in need of both now and in the future.â€ The issue is likely to linger long after the lockdown. The International Air Transport Association says <a href=""https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/iata-passenger-demand-may-not-recover-until-2024/138357.article"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">demand for air travel will not recover until 2023</a> at the earliest. Reduce flights. Demand is unlikely to recover for at least three years so the simplest way to reduce aviation emissions is to have fewer planes in the air. Tax aviation fuel. Initially just for domestic flights so they do not have an unfair advantage against low-emission rail services. Air France has been told it cannot have a bailout unless it phases out flights that compete with train journeys of 2hr 30mins or less. This should later be widened to international flights, which are <a href=""https://www.transportenvironment.org/state-aviation-ets"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">responsible for 90%</a> of airline emissions in Europe.. Introduce a <a href=""http://afreeride.org/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">frequent flyer levy</a>. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the worldâ€™s 7.8bn population flies frequently. Increasing costs for them would make a bigger difference than asking people to end their annual overseas holiday. Provide transparent data on carbon emissions of flights so customers can avoid less efficient airlines. Few people are currently aware of the data, but the difference can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Incorporate the aviation sector into national climate targets. Currently the UKâ€™s Climate Change Act only mentions airlines rather than making them part of the countryâ€™s emissions calculations, which Thunberg described last year as â€œextremely creative accountingâ€. Reduce fleet sizes by scrapping old, gas-guzzling planes. This would also reduce the risk that low petrol prices will prompt budget airlines to rent cheap planes and run them almost empty, which would keep them in business but increase emissions per passenger. Halt airport expansion. Campaigners won an important victory in February when the high court ruled against Heathrow expansion due to the climate risks. But many other airports plan to open new terminals and runways in the UK and elsewhere in the world. Invest in green fuel and tech. The French government has said Air France must use alternatives to fossil fuels for at least 2% of flights by 2024. Norway is pioneering <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180814-norways-plan-for-a-fleet-of-electric-planes"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">electric planes</a> and <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-airplane-biofuels/airlines-get-ready-for-jet-biofuel-take-off-in-norway-idUSKBN1XV1TQ"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">biofuel from waste products</a>. Heathrow says the UK government should also promote cleaner fuel. â€¦ just when we need it the most. The Guardianâ€™s honest, authoritative, fact-based reporting has never mattered more.

</time> <span class=""drop-cap""><span class=""drop-cap__inner"">I</span></span>â€™m sitting down to write this having just cleaned fox poo out of the tiny grooves in the soles<strong> </strong>of my four-year-oldâ€™s sandals. She also, somehow, smeared it all over her legs, her dress, my legs, my shorts. The only plus I can take from it is that, for once in our crowded corner of south London, social distancing was not an issue. Of course, even in non-coronavirus times, 98% of anecdotes about young children end in someone being covered in something or other. But for many parents â€“ at which point I insert an enormous caveat to make it clear that Iâ€™m talking about those who havenâ€™t been infected, or made redundant, and arenâ€™t frontline workers, and are extremely lucky enough to still be operating in a strange bubble of â€œnormalâ€<strong> </strong>â€“<strong> </strong>Iâ€™d suspect that the greatest challenges of the past few weeks, and moments of profoundest despair, have come in the kitchen. Cooking for your children can be a dispiriting experience. Thereâ€™s often a magical window when they are around two, where they eat all sorts of exotic things: green vegetables, non-white food generally, Italian dishes that donâ€™t begin with â€œpâ€. But gradually, imperceptibly, I have found my kids becoming entrenched in their tastes, suspicious of the unfamiliar. Iâ€™m not talking about olives and kimchi; just getting them to eat some courgette involves agreeing to a Peppa Pig all-nighter in return. Not long ago, but BC (before coronavirus), I was moaning to a colleague about it, a serious home cook, a tweezers-and-soda-siphon guy. Also, his children are older, teenagers. I wanted to know if it got any easier. â€œYou have to think of it like being a line cook,â€ he replied, years of pain in his voice. Your job is not to be showy. Itâ€™s to do your bit and get the job done: to make peace with cooking the same meal again and again. Innovation or experimentation were neither expected nor required from your customers (that is, your offspring). I have<strong> </strong>thought about this conversation from time to time after coronavirus took hold, and especially since the schools closed in March, when two major changes became apparent. First, demand: I went from having to supply my children not with two meals a day, but three, plus morning and afternoon snacks (though they helpfully remind me of snack-time by growing fangs and clawing at the fridge, without fail, at 11am and 3pm). The other disruption was supply. Just before we realised how serious the pandemic was, my girlfriend and I raised our eyebrows at friends who went to Asda at 7am on a Sunday morning to stock up. Within days, we were flooded with images of whole aisles of supermarkets cleared out. Toilet roll went first, then pasta, rice, flour, tinned tomatoes. You know all this. The experience of seeing this unfold did, I understand looking back, send me a bit mad. Itâ€™s a clichÃ© (most things about parenthood are) but when you have children itâ€™s hard not to become convinced that your main responsibility now â€“ perhaps the only thing that really matters â€“ is to keep them alive and well. Coronavirus may have made this more real and present than usual for me, but in truth itâ€™s hardwired. Iâ€™m happier when my kids have eaten well, secure in the knowledge that whatever else Iâ€™m getting wrong, that part Iâ€™m not screwing up. I didnâ€™t stockpile or panic buy â€“ not particularly for moral reasons but, in part, because weâ€™ve only got a small freezer and limited shelf space. But I did find myself checking the websites of online shopping companies obsessively: first thing in the morning, my last act before bed, and some days a dozen times in between. I should add here that the online food suppliers and their delivery drivers have done an incredible job of reorganising their systems and keeping things as smooth as they could. My children will never know, or appreciate, how close they came to <em>two days in a row</em> without bananas. Many days, cooking and clearing up after the kids has<strong> </strong>felt like a full-time job (actually worse: it starts at 7am, goes on till past 10pm, and you donâ€™t get half an hour to mull over the perfect phrasing of an email). It is<strong> </strong>exhausting, relentless and relentlessly thankless, as any parent without additional childcare in the normal run of things already knows well. Iâ€™ve been, frankly, astonished at my kidsâ€™ inability to sit at a table for longer than 4.5 seconds without breaking out into song, or wrestling each other, or nipping to their bedroom to get something â€œvery importantâ€ like a small piece of string, or a plastic fish, or a Sylvanian Families Halloween slide set (donâ€™t ask). In order to speed up the four-year-oldâ€™s eating, my girlfriend has invented a game in which she pretends to be a toothbrush (from Texas, I think) who wants nothing more than to â€œstopâ€ our daughter having any more dinner (full rules available on request), which is ultimately very effective but also makes me want to jump out of the window. But as time goes on, Iâ€™ve started to make my peace with the situation.<strong> </strong>Accepting my role as, in Bill Bufordâ€™s words, a kitchen slave, I listen more to what my kids want to eat, rather than bending them to my will. Feeling consulted, they seem to become more open to trying things. Some dinners have been disasters â€“ an attempt to pitch aubergine parmigiana as â€œpizza without the crustâ€ didnâ€™t fly â€“<strong> </strong>but the next morning they just eat a double breakfast. And itâ€™s made me more resourceful: we found a huge patch of wild garlic in a nearby wood, and the kids just about tolerated the pesto we made with it. I dug out various packets of dried pulses from the back of the cupboard, one of which had a best-before date of 2015 and I could only cook by putting instructions through Google Translate, but which were, nonetheless, delicious. On the radio, I heard someone compare life during coronavirus to being on a cruise ship: the three meals provided a structure to a day that otherwise might be disconcertingly free and unhinged. As the weeks became a month, weâ€™ve tried to differentiate the days, or at least the weekends. Sunday night is dress-up dinner night: we do it not to be la-di-da so much as to ensure that our tracksuit bottoms donâ€™t wear out from overuse. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/baking"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Baking</a> kills time and we do some of that: banana bread, soda bread, lots of biscuits. The kids are<strong> </strong>interested for around a minute and a half, drift off, and return to lick the spoons. I havenâ€™t<strong> </strong>made sourdough, unlike everyone else on social media apparently, mainly because itâ€™s too much of a faff, but also because I havenâ€™t got over my Electra complex of killing my â€œmotherâ€ back in 2017. If thereâ€™s been a focal point so far, it was my eldest daughterâ€™s seventh birthday, which fell on Easter Sunday. Obviously thereâ€™d be no party, no friends, fewer presents, but I <em>could</em><em> </em>still make her a cake. When I asked her what kind, she requested â€œmint choc chipâ€ with â€œmarshmallowsâ€, which sounded totally disgusting, but which turned out â€“ by some miracle or misfortune â€“ to match the exact description of grasshopper pie, from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/22/christina-tosi-milk-bar-interview"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Christina Tosiâ€™s </a><em>Momofuku Milk Bar</em> cookbook. Itâ€™s a book Iâ€™ve never previously cooked from, because every recipe contains so many sections that even reading it is exhausting, but if ever there were a time when you conceivably could spend three days baking it was now. (Plus it only required 40g of flour, which was all we had.) At 3pm on my daughterâ€™s birthday, we lit seven candles and brought it out.<strong> </strong>Watching her eating her brown, sludgy dream-cake seemed to put her gag reflex well and truly to the test, but she made polite noises, ate a slice, and we put the rest in the freezer, where we will probably rediscover it in 10 yearsâ€™ time. Of course, the cake didnâ€™t really matter. It was just one of hundreds of meals we will<strong> </strong>make during this strange period. Many people are asking themselves how their lives will change after lockdown. I hope I will be more relaxed about cooking for myself and others, appreciative of and resourceful with what we have. As for cooking the same meals over and over again, Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m not going to think of myself as a line cook. Instead, Iâ€™m recasting myself as a chef with a small range of signature dishes â€“ macaroni cheese, pizza, fish fingers â€“ and a couple of grumpy regulars who are, nonetheless, fiercely loyal. â€¦ just when we need it the most.

The Chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity. As such both of my kids can not only now use a chip pan but they know how to smother a chip pan fire with a damp tea towel. I spend much time cooking now. There are 3 adults in our house, my husband and myself who are vegan and my 27 yo daughter who has Crohn''s and is on a strict diet ... pretty much opposite to ours. So I do 2 main meals. My husband is now concerned he is overweight so wants to eat at lunchtime. I hate eating at lunchtime. So 3 different main meals. He is actually working from home, whilst I am ''working'' from home ie answering a few token emails occasionally and sitting in the garden. <br>In all honesty I don''t mind, I was a product of the 80s where anything but massive career and financial success was viewed as failure, but I have always preferred to be at home with my family. Very much a mother hen. Sadly, we have to afford to eat so I have always had to work. But being at home in lockdown has only emphasised that feeling and I do struggle to see myself returning ... priorities have changed. We arenâ€™t really eating any differently - always cook from scratch. The weirdest thing is that with a child returning; there are three of us 22, 24 and 52; Iâ€™m certain Iâ€™m cooking far less. Cooking is an easy way to be creative after a day of Work via video chats I am in lockdown with my husband - who deals with stress by cooking. My 2 adult sons have moved back in with us - they both love to cook as well. It has all got very competitive. I haven''t needed to cook for 8 weeks. I am also getting fat!! Really? We are finding our children are much happier with meals cooked from scratch from fresh vegetables and other produce than they were when we relied on the weekly supermarket shop. Rather than watch the seemingly endless cookery programs on TV we''ve gone back to trying out recipes from the several shelves of cookery books we''ve bought or been given over the years. Turns out its cheaper too! I''m the cook in our house and I''m totally sick of eating my own food. The kids however don''t seem to mind it. We are having roast pork tonight - I have explained to the kids it is what sausages are made out of to convince them to eat it.<br> <br>Making pack lunches whether they are in or not during the week has been a godsend. Especially with the price of Lidl crisps, juice cartons and ''tracker'' bars. By getting exercised about what your children eat, you are literally handing them power over you on a plate. Cook reasonably healthy meals most of the time, serve them without negotiation, and do not offer alternatives. If they are hungry, they will eat it. If they don''t, don''t show any sign of being upset. That way, food is no longer a power lever for them. Have sandwiches for lunch and cereal or toast for breakfast, so you only cook once a day. Don''t let them snack too much, otherwise they won''t eat meals. Don''t fall for middle class ideas that what your children eat (olives, polenta, avocado, whatever) is a measure of your worth as a person or a parent. It isn''t. I find this so odd, but perhaps I should just think my lucky stars. I was never this kind of eater, nor was my sister, nor is my niece â€“ was it something my mother and then we did right or is it perhaps a familial trait at a genetic level? We always had new and interesting things to try as kids, the rule was that we had to give it a fair try and then if we didnâ€™t like it we really didnâ€™t have to eat it. The same at restaurants â€“ my mom would usually order something predictably pleasing and I would get to pick something exotic that sounded interesting, and then if I didnâ€™t like it we would trade dishes. Weâ€™ve done that with my niece and she remains willing to try damn near anything â€“ and the things she hasnâ€™t liked in the past, like very spicy food, sheâ€™ll still try a bite of to see if sheâ€™s â€œgotten to like it.â€œ As I said, for all I know itâ€™s genetic and nothing weâ€™re doing right. I''m in my mid 60s and it became apparent to my mum, that I was a fussy eater, when we moved to Liverpool, when I was 8. Before that we lived in North Wales. Main meal of the day, at home, bar Sunday was bacon and potatoes. In Liverpool we had choice and I had a whole load of foods that I could refuse. Oddly enough I loved all vegetables, liver and kidneys. I was fine, once I hit puberty, then I would eat anything. Kids know re food, they have a great deal of power. My wife''s quite fussy, I''ve developed ruses like. Describing a dish as North African, when it''s Indian. Thin sliced courgettes, dip in flour then in beaten egg and then flour again and shallow fry. Touch of salt. It appears that when a child approaches 27 the hinges on the doors of dishwashers, washing machines and the like stop working for them. Who knew? 27? Are you sure about that? 100% I thought it was 15.... Kids grow out of it. My younger one complained at age 7, without any irony - ''I haven''t had any bad food today !''. We found the trick was to find a vegetable and fruit that they would eat and give them that - frozen peas or whatever (after being thawed !). He''s a healthy eater now at 21 - they''ll come to no harm most times. What a bizarre article and its lament. I am not trying to be deliberately contrary but even at the best of times, with or without the VIRUS, we all need to eat. So what has changed? U Kids were at school for lunch, possibly also eating at breakfast and/or after school club too. The Author has just realised what a pain in the Aris household chores and childcare can be.<br>Fortunately, I live in a household where we all knew this already, and I''ve been doing the majority of the cooking for years, so lockdown''s not been too much of a culture shock for us. But we could never afford school lunch so my mom made us sandwiches every day. And she was workingâ€¦ Admittedly, we would go out to restaurants on a regular basis. Such a challenge. I recall my aunt serving the midday meal for a threshing crew of five hard labouring men plus four or more kids. The food was superb (mostly home grown), with everything organized and on time. Hard to imagine how she did it all, but she took it in stride. And no one would have put up with kids whinging and whining about the fare. Luxury. Tell young un''s today we were confined to a modest 4 ensuite Thames riverside yarn conversion in Maidenhead with Oat Ham otter lentils and strained leftovers from Heston Bloomingtroll Services, washed down with Fappachinose My grandmother was a farmer''s wife. She had to cook for her immediate family, step family members and farm labourers. My mum used to wax lyrically on what a good cook her mum was. I tactlessly suggested the gift hadn''t been passed down. Mum said, her mother didn''t have the luxury of time; to teach her two daughters how to cook. Mum and her younger sister did the jobs, our nain couldn''t do. Looking after the younger brothers, house work, feeding the farm animals. Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to be able to decide what I would like to have for supper then go out and buy it then cook it <br>Iâ€™ve changed now and Iâ€™m shopping every 2 weeks , using up every bit I buy and saving loads I seriously think that my overriding memory of lockdown will be the relentless emptying of the dishwasher. Think of those of us who don''t have one... You have my sympathy. Mine broke and it nearly tipped me over the edge - it''s bad enough with a dishwasher finding 17 cups in your teenagers bedroom just after you''ve cleared up the kitchen. Luckily my OH managed to fix it. Yes!!! Ours was only used every few days, but now it seems to be on daily!! My path is a pathway for a fox. It''s nice to see it when it appears. Foxy. I bought two packets of prawn noodles and was just about to eat them last night when the ash of my cigarette fell in, the juice.. I still managed to eat the though and nearly all the juice. I''m still disappointed I didn''t get to drink all the juice.. Foxes live in our neighbour''s garden. Our dog and another neighbour''s dog are driven nuts on a regular basis by this as they both detest the foxes. One night I was about to let the dog out for his late night patrol when I realised the two foxes were curled up in the garden. He was desperate to get out but I made sufficient noise opening the door slowly for them to escape first. Iâ€™m the only cook in my house &amp; when I cook I have only 1 gear - Hearty grub &amp; lots of it! Normally this is offset by working hours, eating out etc and eating much, much less. But thereâ€™s no escape now. Weâ€™re all eating at the table now which is great but our waistlines are all expanding! Heart, lungs, liver lights and fries , sound offal, the sort of thing a French chef would cover in a sauce . We are eating at the table too, but funnily donâ€™t have masses of new conversation each day <a class=""js-rec-tooltip-link"" href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN_RECOMM"">Sign in</a> or <a class=""js-rec-tooltip-link"" href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/register?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_REG_RECOMM"">create your Guardian account</a>to recommend a comment', -- PostContent - nvarchar(max)

</time> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Barack Obama</a> has attacked the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Trump administrationâ€™s</a> response to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Covid-19 pandemic</a> during speeches to graduating students. The comments on Saturday were a rare rebuke of a sitting president from one of his predecessors, and come in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 88,000 people in the United States, a death toll far higher than any other country, and had devastating and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">disproportionate effects</a> on communities of color. â€œMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what theyâ€™re doing. A lot of them arenâ€™t even pretending to be in charge,â€ Obama said during an online commencement address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) on Saturday. â€œDoing what feels good, whatâ€™s convenient, whatâ€™s easy â€” thatâ€™s how little kids think,â€ he said in a second virtual speech on Saturday evening for graduating US high school students. â€œUnfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way â€” which is why things are so screwed up. â€œI hope that instead, you decide to ground yourself in values that last, like honesty, hard work, responsibility, fairness, generosity, respect for others.â€ Trump did not respond to Obamaâ€™s comments on Sunday. In an interview with ABC news, Peter Navarro, a top economic adviser to the president, said he was<strong> </strong>â€œglad Mr Obama has a new job as Joe Bidenâ€™s press secretaryâ€. Biden, Obamaâ€™s former vice president, is running against Trump for president. The former presidentâ€™s comments came amid dual crises â€“ one a pandemic disproportionately sickening people of color in the US, and another born by the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">economic impacts</a> of attempts to contain the virus through lockdowns. So far, there have been 1.4 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US. â€œLetâ€™s be honest, a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,â€ said Obama in the HBCU speech. â€œWe see it in the disproportionate impact of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Covid-19</a> on our communities.â€ Those crises, as well as the high-profile <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">killings of black people</a> by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">police</a>, loomed large in the virtual event, itself necessitated by the shutdown of large gatherings to stem the spread of the disease. â€œThese arenâ€™t normal times. Youâ€™re being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession,â€ said Obama. He added that the injustices faced by African Americans are not new, and described the recent high-profile killing of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, an unarmed black jogger who was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/ahmaud-arbery-georgia-prosecutors-under-investigation"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">shot and killed</a> after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in Georgia. â€œWe see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesnâ€™t submit to their questioning,â€ said Obama. Congrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family whoâ€™ve guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! <a href=""https://t.co/RjYvHs2BhC"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">pic.twitter.com/RjYvHs2BhC</a> He went on to use the circumstances of the online graduation as a rallying cry for new graduates: â€œIf the worldâ€™s going to get better, itâ€™s going to be up to you.â€ Although Obama has largely avoided criticizing Trumpâ€™s performance in office, in a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">call leaked last week</a> the former president described the US governmentâ€™s coronavirus response as, â€œ<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/mcconnell-obama-trump-keep-his-mouth-shut"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">an absolute chaotic disaster</a>,â€ and questioned whether the justice departmentâ€™s decision to drop charges against former national security advisor <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-flynn"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Michael Flynn</a> could endanger the â€œ<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">rule of law</a>â€ in the United States. The remarks prompted the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to tell the former president to â€œ<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/mcconnell-obama-trump-keep-his-mouth-shut"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">keep his mouth shut</a>â€. The week also saw the emergence of #<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Obamagate</a>, a conspiracy theory pushed by the president that accuses Obama of attempting to frame Trump for colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election. One former CIA analyst described as â€œ<a href=""â€œa%20hashtag%20in%20search%20of%20a%20scandalâ€."" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">a hashtag in search of a scandal</a>â€. Obamaâ€™s remarks were preceded by speeches and performances by musicians, actors and entertainers such as Steve Harvey, Anthony Hamilton, Doug E Fresh, Wyclef Jean, Common, Kevin Hart, Wendy Raquel Robinson and Vivica A Fox. Messages to graduates tuning in online because they could not hold traditional celebrations on campus were shot through with acknowledgements of Americaâ€™s history of racial segregation. This, speakers said, made the universities essential, while noting the perseverance required to spend a final semester largely online, and the bittersweetness of the moment itself. â€œThis is obviously not the way you wanted to graduate, we get that,â€ said Doc Rivers, coach of the NBAâ€™s Los Angeles Clippers, â€œBut you know what else we know? Youâ€™re going to make us all proud.â€ Graduates, speakers said, would be sent out into an â€œuncertain world,â€ but one they had a chance to improve upon. â€œAs graduates, you now join the ranks of national and world leaders, influencers,â€ said Senator <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Kamala Harris</a> of California. â€œI know this is a trying time, but please do not let the moment of this crisis dampen your ambitions, your hopes or your dreams, because your country needs you,â€ said Harris. She <a href=""https://www.essence.com/news/howard-university-kamala-harris-hbcu-love/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">attended</a> the HBCU Howard, recently ran for the Democratic nomination and is a contender to become Joe Bidenâ€™s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/04/joe-biden-running-mate-vice-president-video"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">running mate</a> in the 2020 election. â€¦ just when we need it the most.

</time> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/miranda-july"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Miranda July</a>, 46, is an acclaimed US film-maker, author and artist. <em>Kajillionaire</em>, her third film, and first for almost a decade, was a hit at Sundance and will be released later this year; her debut, 2005â€™s <em>Me and You and Everyone We Know</em>, is being honoured with a <a href=""https://www.criterion.com/shop"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Criterion Collection</a> edition. There is also the release of a chunky, eponymous monograph that traces her idiosyncratic creative output, with commentary from the likes of Spike Jonze, Carrie Brownstein and David Byrne. She lives in Los Angeles with the director Mike Mills and their son, Hopper. <strong>How are you coping with lockdown in LA?<br></strong>You know, holding up. Iâ€™m healthy, as is my family. And now weâ€™re a bit more used to this new schedule, wherein I teach my child school instead of that child going to school. <strong>Howâ€™s home-schooling going?<br></strong>Itâ€™s a little worrisome. My childâ€™s only in second grade and, like, the mathâ€¦ My husband walked by us the other day and I had 121 pennies out and we are dividing them into groups of 11, because that was the only way I could think of to figure out if 121 was divisible by 11. He said, â€œWhat are you doing that for? Thereâ€™s other ways.â€ And I was like [whispers], â€œI donâ€™t know them!â€ <strong>A theme in your work is about human connection. Have you thought about what longer-term impact coronavirus might have?<br></strong>I have this fantasy that weâ€™ll somehow think of social media and the online world as pandemic tools after this. Weâ€™ll be so grateful for them: weâ€™ll understand that we were brilliant to have thought of this thing that is going to help us survive the many, many pandemics to come, but that we wonâ€™t feel quite as beguiled by them when thereâ€™s not a pandemic, because weâ€™ll have this association. <em><strong>Kajillionaire</strong></em><strong> is about a family of small-time con artists. Youâ€™ve described it as deeply personal but not autobiographical â€“ what do you mean by that?<br></strong>Well, the characters are fictional. I did not grow up like them, or live like that â€“ itâ€™s more an emotional resonance than any practical thing. At Sundance, a number of people came up and were like, â€œThis is so like my family...â€ And then they would describe something that was actually so unfamiliar to me. So I realised, â€œOK, this is extreme enough that this family could be the unconscious of many different kinds of anxious families.â€ <strong>Is your work ever autobiographical?<br></strong>I have only ever written two things that are biographical or based on my life: <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/08/it-chooses-miranda-july-review"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">It Chooses You</a></em>,<em> </em>the book that was about the making of my second movie, and one short story, <em>Itâ€™s Something That Needs Nothing</em><strong> </strong>[which appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em> and her 2007 collection <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview19"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">No One Belongs Here More Than You</a></em>]. <strong>Tell me about thatâ€¦<br></strong>Itâ€™s sort of about gay love and itâ€™s loosely based on me and my first girlfriend. Whereas with<strong> </strong>none of the other stories can I even say that. Or books or movies. <strong>And yet people often assume your work is autobiographical?<br></strong>Maybe that distinction got kind of blurry for people, because I acted in my first feature â€“ even though all my friends looked at that and were like, â€œJust pure fiction.â€ I think people tend to do that to women anyway, sort of assume that theyâ€™re not conceptualising a whole world from the ground up but theyâ€™re pulling from their diary or something. Thereâ€™s a bit of a bias there. <strong>Thereâ€™s an aside in the new book that you somehow got Roseanne Barrâ€™s FedEx number back in the 1990s and youâ€™d use it to ship things. Was that just what you had to do to make it as an artist?<br></strong>I think very few people <em>have</em> to use <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/roseanne-barr"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Roseanne Barr</a>â€™s FedEx number for their artwork. In my 20s, my rebellions were not always that enlightened, they were for their own sake. And it maybe took a little while to realise: look how radical you could be in how you do your work, all that energy can go into <em>this</em>. This is a great place for it! <strong>Looking at the new book, it seems you keep everything from your life and work. What was the weirdest thing you found in your archive?<br></strong>Thereâ€™s a man in my neighbourhood, heâ€™s quasi-homeless and I pay him to do different gardening things. Heâ€™s the only person I talk to, other than my family, every day. He also gives me letters and gifts. And Iâ€™ve saved every single thing over 15 years that heâ€™s given me, except for a few things that eventually attracted rats, like boxes of chocolate <strong>What sort of things?<br></strong>A baby blanket, a 56-colour eyeshadow kit, a purse. They are taking up a disproportionate amount of room now, but at a certain point, once you start saving things you canâ€™t stop. Things accrue meaning because theyâ€™re saved, sometimes.<br> <strong>What will you do next?<br></strong>At this point it seems pretty clear that after I make a movie, I write a book. So Iâ€™m writing a novel now; thatâ€™ll be done in many years. <strong>In a strange way, might you have more time now you are stuck at home on lockdown?<br></strong>If I was 25 without kids, that would be the case, but Iâ€™ve barely written at all since the pandemic. But if I wasnâ€™t writing this novel, Iâ€™d be awfully tempted to invent something that could only function at this time. I see people are doing that.<strong> </strong>Thereâ€™s so much anarchistic potential for self-invention and to dismantle all these old-fashioned ways of doing things. Thatâ€™s really interesting to me and, frankly, sort of distracting. I have to not get pulled into that; I have to tell myself: â€œOther people should do that. You should write your novel.â€<br> <span class=""bullet"">â€¢</span> <em>Miranda July</em> is published by Prestel (Â£39.99).

In the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/26/bernie-sanders-california-amazon-latino-activism"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Inland Empire region outside </a><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/26/bernie-sanders-california-amazon-latino-activism"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline""> Los Angeles</a>, Amazon workers told the Guardian they fear losing their jobs if they are ill and stay home. At least <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-04-09/fearful-of-covid-19-amazon-workers-ask-for-state-probe-of-working-conditions"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">four</a> Amazon warehouses in the region have recorded Covid-19 cases. On 1 May, Amazon ended a policy allowing unlimited unpaid time off, a measure adopted at the start of the coronavirus crisis that allowed workers to take time off for any reason. They would forgo wages, but if they were concerned about their safety or had new childcare responsibilities due to lockdowns, they could stay home without losing their jobs. Without the policy, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/retail-workers-at-amazon-and-whole-foods-coordinate-sick-out-to-protest-covid-19-conditions"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">workers say</a> they could now be fired if they miss shifts. They worry the reversal will result in sick and vulnerable people showing up for shifts because they canâ€™t risk termination. The health concerns are particularly serious in the Inland Empire, which has some of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/26/bernie-sanders-california-amazon-latino-activism"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">worst air quality in the US</a> and disproportionately high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Employees also shared emails showing that Amazon has dismissed some paid sick leave requests by claiming a California law intended to provide supplemental sick leave during the pandemic does not apply to the warehouses. â€œIâ€™m afraid to come to work, but I donâ€™t have a choice,â€ said Eddie, a 48-year-old San Bernardino worker with diabetes, who asked to go by his middle name and works in one of the facilities that had an outbreak. â€œI shouldnâ€™t be there. Weâ€™re risking our safety for the company â€¦ The more I think about it, the more stressed I get.â€ â€œWe are a vector of this disease,â€ said one worker at a warehouse in San Bernardino. The 27-year-old, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, recovered from pneumonia last year and is at high risk of serious complications if they contract Covid. â€œThere shouldnâ€™t even be a debate about this. Itâ€™s incredibly nerve-racking.â€ The Inland Empire, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, was once home to the west coastâ€™s <a href=""https://clui.org/ludb/site/kaiser-steel-plant-site"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">largest</a> steel plant, a major air force <a href=""https://www.sbsun.com/2019/03/29/san-bernardino-marks-25-years-since-closing-of-norton-air-force-base-eyes-future/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">base</a> and an agricultural <a href=""https://inlandempire.us/the-hidden-histories-behind-californias-citrus-industry/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">economy</a>. Today, the historically rural area is a hub for distribution centers and the logistics industry, with <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-01/la-me-inland-warehouse-rules"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">huge warehouses</a> for Amazon, UPS, Walmart and other retailers. The sector has <a href=""https://www.ocregister.com/2018/02/05/opinion-amazon-has-powerful-impact-on-the-inland-empire-economy/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">added</a> more than 50,000 jobs over the last decade as e-commerce has boomed, but a <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-inland-empire-jobs-20181128-story.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">majority of families</a> in the region donâ€™t earn enough to make ends meet. On 16 April, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, passed an <a href=""https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/16/governor-newsom-announces-paid-sick-leave-benefits-for-food-sector-workers-impacted-by-covid-19-additional-protections-for-consumers/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">executive order</a> providing food sector workers two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave if they have to isolate due to Covid-19 concerns. The <a href=""https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ-for-PSL.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">law</a> covers â€œworkers at warehouses where food is storedâ€ and is aimed at protecting consumers from the virus and offering additional support to essential workers whose jobs involve the food supply. Amazon warehouses in the industrial neighborhoods of San Bernardino and Riverside counties handle a wide range of packages, including food items. But employees say that when they have asked about Newsomâ€™s order in recent weeks, the human resources department has ignored their questions or responded that the facilities are not considered part of the food sector. The 27-year-old worker with a history of pneumonia works at a sort center and has been responsible for helping package a range of pantry food items. When they asked HR about the paid sick leave law for food workers, the company directed them to steps they could take to request unpaid time off. A labor spokesperson for the state, however, told the Guardian that the law does apply to warehouses such as Amazonâ€™s centers, noting that the order has a broad definition of â€œfood facilityâ€, which includes any operations that store or package food for human consumption. Eileen Hards, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to answer specific questions about Newsomâ€™s order or whether the company has provided this form of paid sick leave, saying in an email: â€œAmazon has complied with all requirements given by the State.â€ The company says in addition to the time off it provided before the coronavirus pandemic, it now gives two weeks of paid time off for infected employees and those presumed to have Covid-19. But in one recent case, a worker who tested positive only received his pay after a <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-employee-positive-coronavirus-one-month-no-pay"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">BuzzFeed reporter inquired about it</a>, and employees across the country have <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-workers-not-getting-quarantine-pay"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">reported</a> difficulties getting any sick pay during the pandemic. Californiaâ€™s law also appears to be broader than Amazonâ€™s policy, requiring paid leave for workers who have to isolate due to health concerns, including if they live with someone sick or exposed, and it <a href=""https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ-for-PSL.html"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">says</a> they are entitled to â€œimmediatelyâ€ start leave upon request. â€œPeople are absolutely going to show up sick. They have to,â€ said a 23-year-old worker at an Amazon fulfillment center in Rialto, a city near San Bernardino. The worker recently stopped going to work out of fear, even though he now risks losing his job and gets no paid time off. â€œWeâ€™re all crammed in there. Itâ€™s gonna get bad.â€ A San Bernardino worker in her 40s, who has two children with asthma, said she was terrified of getting them sick but would not stop working: â€œNecessity is bigger than my fear. I need to pay my bills. If I donâ€™t go, then my family is going to lose my home.â€ Amazon confirmed that it had ended its unlimited unpaid time off policy, but the company says it continues to allow the option on a case-by-case basis. Workers accrue roughly 80 hours of unpaid time off over the course of a year, and they can now also apply for an unpaid personal leave of absence due to Covid concerns. But it can take weeks for Amazon to respond to these requests, and multiple employees who asked for this said their requests were â€œpendingâ€ and that they were worried they would soon lose their jobs. Amazon workers across the US have accused the company of not doing enough to protect their health and safety amid the pandemic. Amazon has fired several employee activists after they participated in organizing actions, and a high-profile <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">vice-president resigned</a> this week over the firings. Meanwhile, Amazon has experienced a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/30/amazon-revenues-jeff-bezos-coronavirus-pandemic"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">boom in sales</a> during the pandemic, with revenues of $75.4bn in the first three months of 2020, over $33m an hour. The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/heads-we-win-tails-you-lose-how-americas-rich-have-turned-pandemic-into-profit"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">fortune of CEO Jeff Bezos</a> has grown by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">$24bn during the crisis</a>. â€œItâ€™s wild that weâ€™re asking for an [unlimited unpaid time off policy] to be returned, because even that was never enough,â€ said a San Bernardino employee in their 20s, who works at a sort center and is on an unpaid leave of absence. â€œIt was a bare minimum so people who could afford to could have the chance to stay home without jeopardizing their job.â€ The worker said they had another part-time job they could do from home and had some money saved as they worked toward graduate school: â€œThis is going to set me back.â€ Amazon has made changes over the last two months to try to enforce distancing within the warehouses, but the worker said the nature of the job made it hard to avoid other people. Another benefit of the unlimited time off was that the facilities became slightly less crowded, they said. A 25-year-old who lives in Riverside county and has worked for Amazon for more than two years noted that Amazon was continuing to hire new workers as employees quit in fear. â€œWe donâ€™t know what these people are bringing in. Infections are going to spike indefinitely,â€ said the worker, who has a baby and lives with his two older parents, who both have a range of health issues. â€œIf I donâ€™t go to work, I die of starvation. If I come home with an infection, I nearly kill half my family.â€ Due to the lockdowns, he couldnâ€™t find any other work. â€œMe and a lot of others have broke our back for Amazon â€¦ Itâ€™s almost like the virus doesnâ€™t exist around them and all they care about are their numbers.â€ Hards, the Amazon spokeswoman, said the company was â€œencouraging those who are unwell to stay home and taking extreme measures to keep people safe in our buildingsâ€. â€œNothing is more important than the safety of our teams,â€ she added. â€¦ just when we need it the most.

</time> NHS officials are racing to introduce greater privacy safeguards for the contact-tracing app at the centre of the governmentâ€™s lockdown exit strategy amid mounting concern from security experts, MPs and users. Whitehall sources conceded to the Guardian that they were â€œtwo steps behind in public engagementâ€ because the app â€“ which tracks everyone a user has met and warns them to self-isolate when the user reports Covid-19 symptoms â€“ has had to be developed at high speed. It plans to complete the appointment of an ethics board to improve oversight and publish the software source code in the next month, and has not ruled out â€œa sunset clauseâ€, agreeing to delete all data collected once the country returns to normal. On Monday, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">Matt Hancock</a> announced that the NHS Covid-19 tracing app would be tested on the Isle of Wight this week before being deployed around the UK by the end of the month to monitor and contain future outbreaks. But there are growing worries about public take-up after security specialists and MPs raised concerns, in particular over the central database which will contain anonymised records of those reporting symptoms and who their phone has come in contact with. Robert Hannigan, a former director of the governmentâ€™s intelligence and security organisation, GCHQ, said while he thought the app was â€œnot a threat to individualsâ€ because it only recorded a personâ€™s postcode alongside a unique reference number for each phone, it was right that the exercise in surveillance should be reviewed after the crisis. â€œMy own feeling is that this should be time limited. So, at the end of the pandemic we need to pause this experiment and have a proper public debate, and parliamentary debate, about the use of these apps in the future,â€ he said. A former chairman of the culture media and sport select committee, Damian Collins, wrote to Hancock, the health secretary, with a series of questions arguing that it was â€œvital there is a high level of supportâ€ for the app, which required â€œreassurances to be given about both its effectiveness and the processes for controlling the data gathered by itâ€. The Conservative MP asked whether the app and data collected â€œwould be destroyed at the end of the pandemicâ€, as Australia has agreed to do, to prevent it being used for other purposes by government. The app has been developed by NHSX, a digital unit jointly under the Department of Health and the NHS. Those involved say that any data collected â€“ a unique monitoring of the British population â€“ will not be shared with any other government departments or private companies. Retaining some information in a central database has been deemed necessary because it allows the NHS to track regional outbreaks and obtain information about the future spread of the disease. Google and Apple have tried to promote an alternative database-free decentralised approach, which was rejected by the UK. Ministers want 60% of the population to download the app in order for it to be most effective in monitoring coronavirus outbreaks, but insiders concede that it may be taken up by somewhere closer to 20% at first until concerns about monitoring and privacy are properly dealt with. Prof Lillian Edwards, a specialist in internet law from Newcastle University, said that while the contact data being retained was described as anonymous, it was nevertheless personal â€“ and that she was concerned that members of the public would not have the right to have it deleted. â€œThatâ€™s a basic right under our privacy rules â€“ the famous right to be forgotten â€“ and it shows up some basic problems with the centralised architecture,â€ she added. But Raab said at the governmentâ€™s daily press conference that the UK wanted to develop its own bespoke technology, and had taken appropriate security advice. â€œThe reality is we want the app to be focused on the UK and we want the technology to be tailored to make sure we can deal with the specific challenges weâ€™ve got in this country,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™ve worked with the experts weâ€™ve got at the National Cyber Security Centre to make sure weâ€™ve got the greatest protections on things like privacy.â€ Technical experts also raised concerns. Smartphone operating systems impose strict limits on normal apps that prevent them from infringing user privacy, harming performance, or breaking other apps. Those limits affect the operation of the NHSâ€™s centralised app: on iPhones, for instance, the app will stop broadcasting its identifier when another app is being actively used, and will only start broadcasting if it hears another identifier first. That means two iPhone users sat next to each other on a train, both playing the game Candy Crush, would fail to register as a contact, unless a third phone was nearby with the app open. â€œOn iOS, there are background services issues,â€ says Graeme Scott, founder of critical intelligence platform Synoptic. â€œThe issue the NHS has is that this is a 24-hour situation, dealing with background services when you canâ€™t have certain functionality available. Which then begs the question: how reliable it will be?â€ On Tuesday, the deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Angela McLean, praised South Korea for its track-and-trace system, which it rolled out in March. The country has a population of 51 million and 245 deaths from coronavirus, while Britain, with a population of 66 million, has a death toll of more than 29,000. â€œFind people who have symptoms, get them tested, find good quick reliable ways to find people they have been in contact with and ask them to go into quarantine,â€ McLean told the daily government press conference. â€œThat is the strategy that has worked in South Korea and South Korea is really the place in the world we can look to and say â€˜this workedâ€™. They did have quite a big outbreak actually that they brought under control with contact tracing so I think they are a fine example to us and we should try and emulate what theyâ€™ve achieved.â€ â€¦ just when we need it the most.

</time> <span class=""drop-cap""><span class=""drop-cap__inner"">A</span></span> person in a grass-covered suit lurks behind a wheelie bin before sprinting down a residential cul-de-sac. In a cramped bathroom, five housemates lip-sync in a limescale-stained bath. NHS staff dance on a deserted ward. A family of four performs a dance routine in a suburban garden. The father is out of time. These are the faces of the UKâ€™s TikTok obsession. Across the country, in teenage bedrooms and house shares, Brits stuck at home by the coronavirus lockdown are firing up <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/en/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">TikTok</a>, propping their phones against walls and hitting record. Founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline"">TikTok</a> is one of the most popular video-sharing apps in the world, downloaded more than 2bn times globally. Users create 15-second clips set to music or soundbites, which they can overlay with digital special effects. Before the coronavirus pandemic, TikTok was predominantly favoured by British teenagers, who posted prank videos or the latest trending dance routine on it. But since the lockdown, TikTok has become a seething leviathan of user-generated content, chewing down our boredom, our fatigue and our fear and spitting them back at us in 15-second chunks, to be digested ad infinitum. According to mobile industry analysts Sensor Tower, one in three Brits â€“ 24 million people â€“ has TikTok installed on their devices. The week before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, 278,000 UK users downloaded TikTok on their phones, up 6% from the week previously. For the week of 23 March, when lockdown was enforced, UK installations surged by 34%. In lieu of going to bars, pubs or clubs, Britons would be staying in â€“ and whiling away our time on TikTok. I keep asking 18-year-old <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYpWK/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Madeline Mai-Davies</a> what itâ€™s like to be an overnight TikTok celebrity, but all she can do is rattle off numbers for me. â€œSo the bush-man video went viral on 16.5m views,â€ Mai-Davies says giddily, â€œand the video where I pretended to surprise my boyfriend naked, now thatâ€™s got 12.5m views.â€ After joining TikTok just six days ago, the unemployed waitress from Stevenage â€“ like almost everyone else in the hospitality sector, coronavirus cost Mai-Davies her job â€“ has 210,000 followers. In less time than it takes for a banana to go brown, she has accrued an online following double the circulation of some national newspapers. How does she feel? â€œTo be fair, it has been a headfuck,â€ she responds, before reeling off more figures. Mai-Davies became a TikTok influencer after a video she posted of her boyfriend pretending to break the coronavirus lockdown â€“ by creeping down their road in a grass-covered costume â€“ went viral. (At the time of writing, it had 1.6m views.) Sudden fame has left Mai-Davies punch-drunk on her own celebrity. â€œ<em>This Morning</em> got in contact with me,â€ she says breathlessly. â€œThey want me to FaceTime Holly and Phil. Weâ€™ve been in hundreds of articles in 20 different counties.â€ Becoming a TikTok influencer is now a viable career. â€œI want to be a content creator and make people laugh,â€ says 24-year-old <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nsT2WV/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Akafi Ali</a>, from London. Ali quit his job as a Sainsburyâ€™s cashier to pursue his TikTok dream: his videos satirise Somali culture or feature Ali on caterwauling form. â€œEveryone is going to the supermarket to grab toilet rolls!â€ Ali says in one video. â€œAre you serious? Just wash your ass!â€ Ali says TikTok was already popular before coronavirus, but that the lockdown has supercharged it. â€œThere are a lot more people jumping on,â€ he says. With this influx of new influencers comes competition. â€œBefore, if you uploaded a video, you could easily get 100,000 views in the first hour,â€ says Ali. â€œBut now you donâ€™t get on the For You page as easily as before.â€ (For You is the landing page on TikTok, tailored to usersâ€™ interests.) Mai-Davies also plans to give the TikTok influencer thing a go and is posting daily videos. â€œWhen I go to bed, I think about ideas for tomorrowâ€™s video,â€ she says. She tells me that some young girls have set up a fan page about her on Instagram. â€œThey write, â€˜I love her so much, sheâ€™s my Queen,â€™â€ she says. She sounds bemused. â€œThis is so crazy. How have I got a fan page?â€ The most important thing to understand about TikTok is that it is anarchic: it has no internal logic or guiding principle. Many TikTok videos are absurdist jokes. People surprise family members, impersonate celebrities or set up elaborate punchlines. The platform frequently has the surreal quality of a fever dream: videos riff on arcane internet ephemera or make nonsensical jokes. Non-sequiturs are common. Creativity is paramount. â€œSurrealism is embedded into the DNA of the internet,â€ says Kenneth Goldsmith, author of <em>Wasting Time on the Internet</em>. He sees TikTokâ€™s popularity as a natural reaction to the oppressive mania of a global lockdown â€“ it is a pressure valve for people cooped up indoors. â€œThe only response to an existential situation is absurdity and humour,â€ Goldsmith says. â€œIt brings us back to the darker side of surrealism.â€ On Instagram, we are primped and preening, on Twitter, loudmouthed and strident, but on TikTok, we can just be weird. Which makes it the perfect platform to ride out a pandemic that has nearly one-third of the worldâ€™s population trapped at home. â€œItâ€™s therapeutic,â€ Goldsmith explains. â€œIf we look at Freudâ€™s theorising of the joke, the joke is always about showing humour in the face of death.â€ â€œIâ€™m sort of embarrassed by it,â€ says <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGNWao/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">John Palmer</a> of his TikTok account. The 17-year-old, from County Durham, specialises in the sort of hyper-surreal videos youâ€™d expect to jump into through a chalk pavement drawing â€“ if Mary Poppins used TikTok. Typically, Palmerâ€™s videos refer to popular memes or obscure internet jokes. In one video, Palmer rips a much-memed Michelle Obama soundbite to make a joke about Prince William using coronavirus to leapfrog Charles in the line of succession. In another, he pretends to talk to the squadron of imaginary friends heâ€™s made in self-isolation. â€œItâ€™s sort of about finding the template, but pushing the meme as far as it will go, making it weirder and weirder, until it gets to a point where it doesnâ€™t make sense unless youâ€™ve seen everything else before,â€ Palmer says. â€œIt spirals down into something else.â€ This is TikTok as pure subculture: in order to participate at Palmerâ€™s level, you need to have swum through digital water since childhood, a graceful stroke through each platform â€“ Facebook, Vine, Instagram â€“ that is easy and assured. There is no need for gatekeepers: the price of admission to this subculture is simply understanding the joke. â€œI show it to my parents and they donâ€™t get it,â€ Palmer explains. â€œItâ€™s the meme culture of Gen Z. Thereâ€™s so much background to memes. You need to have lived through them.â€ As a TikTok old timer, Palmer is mortified by the platformâ€™s exploding popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. â€œIâ€™m not looking forward to all of the adults discovering TikTok,â€ he says with a sigh. Thereâ€™s a simple reason why people are flocking to TikTok: itâ€™s a superb time waster. And in lieu of freedom or gainful employment, right now the only thing the British public has in abundance is time to burn. â€œPeople are just looking for ways to keep themselves occupied,â€ says TikTok creator <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary/video/6807502301582871814"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Rachel Leary</a>, 23, from Manchester. â€œHaving TikTok on your phone is a really easy thing to do to pass the time. Thereâ€™s nothing else to do.â€ TikTok is designed to be addictive: you can scroll its dashboard for hours without ever running out of content. Its algorithm uses artificial intelligence to observe your interests and deliver videos that fit. Palmer tells me that since downloading TikTok on his phone, his screen time has gone up from seven hours a day to 12. And when you finally tire of scrolling through TikTokâ€™s neverending dashboard, you can start making videos. Palmer only started posting his own videos when the coronavirus lockdown started. â€œI was locked in the house and had nothing else to do,â€ he says. â€œI thought making a video might be something to do for a day to occupy myself.â€ He sounds surprised. â€œBut then I continued with it.â€ TikTok is a curative to boredom: there is always a new challenge to try or dance routine to learn. â€œTikTok is a space for the familiar play weâ€™ve seen on the internet for decades now,â€ says Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston. â€œChallenges that went around on YouTube or Facebook, like the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/30/als-after-the-ice-bucket-challenge"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">ice-bucket challenge</a> or the Kylie Jenner challenge, are now on TikTok.â€ And although many TikTok videos may appear inane on first viewing, making a successful TikTok video takes skill, care and creativity. â€œWhen youâ€™re writing the caption on TikTok, it really has to flow well and have the right syntax,â€ Palmer says, â€œbecause if itâ€™s too confusing people donâ€™t like it or ignore it. It has to flow really well.â€ Leary reshot her most popular TikTok video â€“ in which she pretends to DJ to the BBC News theme tune using household cleaning products â€“ to improve her comic timing. â€œI didnâ€™t instantly look at it and think, thatâ€™s so funny,â€ she explains. â€œSo I refilmed it and the second time I took a swig of wine. Thatâ€™s the part of the video that people have found the funniest and commented on.â€ Her instinct was correct: the video has received 151,000 likes and was played on the BBC. Another characteristic of TikTok that makes it well suited to the coronavirus lockdown: it is primarily an indoor platform. â€œTikTok has always been about being 15 and staying at home,â€ explains David Nichols of the University of Melbourne. â€œThatâ€™s the accepted backdrop. And now everyone has to stay at home! So TikTok was made for coronavirus. Not deliberately, but it was.â€ Unlike Instagram, where influencers swagger in front of a rotating backdrop of cocktail bars and tropical beaches, TikTokkers have always filmed themselves at home, in their bedrooms. â€œInstagram is more for like going out and getting drunk or going on holiday,â€ Palmer says. â€œInstagram is superficial. But TikTok is just people posting stupid things and itâ€™s addictive, so you can keep going and going.â€ Many of the young people I speak to say a variant of the same thing: TikTok used to be uncool, until suddenly it wasnâ€™t. Palmer tells me that his peers would often write â€œHere as a jokeâ€ on their TikTok bios, because they were embarrassed to be on the app. â€œIf TikTok came up in conversation, everyone would say, â€˜Urgh, no one goes on that,â€™â€ says 16-year-old <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGjfv5/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Libby Atkinson</a>, from Manchester. Coronavirus supercharged a process that was already taking place: the process of TikTok becoming cool. â€œAll my friends are coming on it because they have nothing to do,â€ says Atkinson. As a result, more young people are jumping ship, from Instagram to TikTok. â€œEveryone is moving away from Instagram to TikTok,â€ says Ali. â€œItâ€™s going to become the No 1 app that everyone is using.â€ This exodus of Gen Z from Instagram to TikTok mirrors the way millennials dumped Facebook in the 2010s. â€œApps are generational in a half-decade sense,â€ says Milner. â€œIt makes perfect sense that Gen Z would have their own platform and it would be TikTok. If you look at Instagram and everyone on it is aged 25 and older, you want to find your own place.â€ Even as we abscond from Instagram in droves, TikTok would not exist without it. Milner says: â€œSomething unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical bodyâ€¦ That wouldnâ€™t have happened had Instagram not made us much more used to having our face and bodies being on camera.â€ Instagram sandblasted away our self-consciousness: it made us comfortable with being on camera. Where 16-year-olds go, adults follow. Celebrities including <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGFEbf/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Lizzo</a>, <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGBpRd/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Britney Spears</a> and <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYrat/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Justin Bieber</a> have posted TikTok videos during the lockdown. Non-celebrities are also flooding the app: Learyâ€™s mum has become hooked on the platform. â€œShe keeps telling me that she canâ€™t stop scrolling,â€ Leary laughs. â€œTikTok has made it into the mainstream now,â€ says Nichols. â€œItâ€™s part of popular culture. A year ago, Iâ€™d have to explain what TikTok was to adults.â€ As TikTok grows up, it loses its countercultural edge. â€œI discovered it through my daughter,â€ explains Wendy Paintain, a 54-year-old from Lichfield. â€œShe was throwing herself around the living room, in front of her phone. I thought, <em>what on earth is this rubbish? </em>I downloaded it to have a look. And then I thought, actually, itâ€™s quite entertaining.â€ She lets rip a loud laugh. Paintain is the creative brains behind the Grandad Joe TikTok account, which features lighthearted videos of her father, Joe, 87, who is self-isolating with her during the pandemic, dancing and making jokes. The <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nGR6BN/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Grandad Joe</a> account blew up after Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views. Since then, Joe has been accepted into the TikTok top creators programme, been invited for TV appearances and has even started to make money from brand partnerships. â€œHeâ€™s grown really quickly,â€ says Paintain of her fatherâ€™s TikTok account. â€œHe got 1.6 million followers in nine weeks. Heâ€™s even got a blue tick!â€ (An indicator of a verified celebrity.) She takes me upstairs to speak to Joe, who is having a nap. â€œI canâ€™t understand why itâ€™s so popular, really,â€ Joe tells me. â€œIâ€™m an old fossil. I guess Iâ€™m having my 15 minutes of fame. Did you know that I might be going on the telly?â€ Alongside these older content creators, official bodies have been using TikTok to publish public health information during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has uploaded TikTok videos urging people to stay at home; the World Health Organization has 1.4 million followers on the app. During the Easter bank holiday weekend, when many feared people may break lockdown rules, due to the warm weather, the UK government ran ads on TikTok, asking people to stay at home. Coronavirus trends float through the app, like driftwood. Thereâ€™s the #iwillsurvivechallenge (where users wash their hands to the Gloria Gaynor anthem), and the #stayathomechallenge, where <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nsEtDt/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">NHS workers</a> and TikTok creators urge users to stay indoors, sharing exercise routines or cooking tips to pass the time. (The #stayathomechallenge has more than 2.6bn views.) Bored in the House, the song by Tyga and up-and-coming rapper Curtis Roach, has become <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/music/BORED-IN-THE-HOUSE-6800281264655026950?lang=en"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">TikTokâ€™s unofficial coronavirus anthem</a>: more than 2m videos have been created using the song, with more than 923 million views globally. All coronavirus content on TikTok has a banner linking to reputable news sources. The appâ€™s UK general manager, Richard Waterworth, says: â€œWe [have] introduced a range of in-app features, notifications and safety measures specifically designed to elevate credible and accurate information from trusted sources.â€ But preventing the spread of fake news can be difficult to enforce in practice: conspiracy theories linking 5G to coronavirus are easy to find. Healthcare workers have also turned to the app. â€œTraditional TikTok was a dance platform,â€ says NHS doctor and former <em>Love Island</em> contestant <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/nsvwyh/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Alex George</a>. The 29-year-old has 104,000 followers on TikTok, where he posts videos explaining how coronavirus is transmitted or the correct way to wash your hands. â€œBut thatâ€™s not true any more. People are engaging with health content.â€ Coronavirus has helped TikTok to grow up. What was once a platform for uninhibited free play, detached from the cares and concerns of the outside world, has become outward facing. Although this is not the first time that TikTokkers have been civic-minded â€“ during the 2019 Australian bushfires, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/23/australian-teens-turn-to-tiktok-to-mock-pm-over-hawaii-holiday-during-fire-crisis"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">users ridiculed Australian prime minister Scott Morrisonâ€™s handling of the crisis</a> and raised money for affected communities â€“ coronavirus has pushed TikTok into a new prominence. TikTok itself has pledged â‚¬62m to support European healthcare workers and communities affected by the pandemic. George is hopeful that his videos will communicate key public health messages to a younger audience. â€œYoung people donâ€™t engage with traditional media forms,â€ he says, â€œbut they might watch my TikTok videos and educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly.â€ <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@sorchamackenzie?lang=en"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">Sorcha Mackenzie</a> joined TikTok long before coronavirus. She did so for the same reason many other people will be downloading it right now: because she was lonely. â€œAt the time, I was pretty socially isolated,â€ explains Mackenzie, a 28-year-old artist from Melbourne. â€œI was running this gallery across town, in the docklands, and itâ€™s a pretty desolate area. Not many people come there. I would be there all day, until late at night, on my own every single day.â€ She was rapidly hooked. â€œIt made the world feel like a very big place,â€ Mackenzie explains. â€œYou feel interconnected.â€ Mackenzie believes the new TikTok users are reaching out for the same thing she craved during her days in that abandoned Melbourne dockyard: a sense of community. â€œIt makes perfect sense to me why TikTok has boomed and so many people have downloaded it at the moment,â€ Mackenzie says. â€œIt offers a salve to isolation.â€ As the British public hunkers down at home, alone, in some cases literally returning to the bedrooms of its youth, TikTok connects us to an online community of people who are also muddling along as best as they can. â€œIt feels like a safe place,â€ says Atkinson. â€œYou donâ€™t feel like youâ€™re being judged.â€ The sublime and the serious, the silly and the strange: TikTok is the perfect platform for these times. As the world changes, people whoâ€™d never have dreamed of posting videos of themselves dancing in their pyjamas online or lip-syncing in their kitchen, think: why not? â€œIt feels like such an uncomfortable, incredibly bizarre moment,â€ says Mackenzie, â€œand thereâ€™s such a big shift in everything. People are forced to take stock of what is important. They lose that sense of ego or barrier of caring about what other people think about them.â€ TikTok allows us to see others and be seen ourselves. It brings levity to otherwise dark and anxiety-filled days. It lets the air in. Layer by layer, the coronavirus pandemic has peeled away our braggadocio and our hubristic plans for the future and returned all of us to a childlike state. We sit at home, like children, and wait to be told what to do. And while we wait, we play online. â€¦ just when we need it the most.

It was doing remarkably well before... The micropayments and gift structure are ripe for abuse however. It''s practically employing young people as emotional prostitutes for the young. The BBC news did quite a good episode on the ''issues'' with the service. I guess as the service is ''problematic'' ""and returned all of us to a childlike state. We sit at home, like children, and wait to be told what to do. And while we wait, we play online."" Pay online - you did a good article on dangers of stock trading companies - have a look at ticktock figures. Rather than normalise. Well, of course the BBC won''t like rivals for eyeballs. but teen users are worried it will lose its cool At least they''ve got something important to worry about. Likewise. Having been trapped at home ''shielding'' - other than for the periodic ''russian roulette'' trips to the corner shop, because ''shielding'' does not mean ''supported'' - I''ve been bored enough to create accounts on all the social media to check whether I misjudged them in the past. So. Create a random, fake, account on Tik Tok, start swiping and, after a few thousand swipes, what has Tik Tok shown you? The grandad shopping one stood out as the only one of any worth. There are loads of scantily clad ladies ''dancing'' and pleading you to be an ''only fan'' whatever that is. Quite a few scantily clad men doing the same. A shedload of people bragging sexual inuendo, insults and boasts. A large number of idiots being unpleasant. Some unfunny commedians .......... Not impressed. Not by the content. Its mostly sleazy, sad, desperate, narssistic and depressing. The video making is undoubtedly skilled. But, overall, its just ''sad'' - like an attention deficit You Tube without all the pirated commerical content theft. So. after a couple of days, I deleted the app. Its easy to see how watching a lot of that stuff would cause mental illness. Thanks for the report, genuinely. The 0.1% chance I had of trying it out has now been happily expunged. Thanks for your legwork on this. I''ll can now add TikTok to the list of social media sites I''ll never bother to join. Thanks for posting this review. I was never likely to install the app but I did wonder what it was all about and you gave a great explanation. â€œSomething unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical bodyâ€¦ â€ Is that a good thing - with the internet having made narcissism laced with body dysmorphia into such a killer mental illness? Hmmm. Where is TikTok from? Iâ€™m not sure- I suspect a small village in Finland dedicated to world harmony. Something like that. The fastest rising global power "" educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly ""<br>They''ll be educating them in the best ways to suck eggs next. <i>Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views.</i> Did it really? Any verification of the numbers or is it all just meaningless hype?<br>I''m intrigued about this ''viral'' thing. Do people really really see hundreds of banal things on the internet and feel the overwhelming urge to share every one with everybody they know? If they did we''d be bombarded with hundreds or even thousands of ''shares'' every day - I''m not, is anybody else? I think it becomes â€œeveryone else is sharing this/talking about this so I willâ€. Once something hits a certain tipping point it naturally snowballs. I recommend book Adam Kurcharskiâ€™s â€˜ The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread - and Why They Stopâ€™ if you are interested in this. Thanks for the recommendation. I''ve just googled the title and it looks like something I''d enjoy. According to this article Tik Tok (which seems to have had a big marketing budget over the last 4 months) is harmless fun. Not a single mention of this <br><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/tiktok-and-the-long-arm-of-the-chinese-government/2019/12/02/1064a72c-1142-11ea-b0fc-62cc38411ebb_story.html%3foutputType=amp"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/tiktok-and-the-long-arm-of-the-chinese-government/2019/12/02/1064a72c-1142-11ea-b0fc-62cc38411ebb_story.html%3foutputType=amp</a> They fudge the numbers and support. They are able and willing to do this because of where its from. <br>Do your kids a favour and tell them at what cost the silly dance. This is a Chinese app. Be very careful downloading this. What? Should we be equally careful when downloading Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, why? @Maddix123 Would this convince you?<br><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/105488067649967/videos/1477612639081755"" rel=""nofollow"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline"">https://www.facebook.com/105488067649967/videos/1477612639081755</a>/ Great app if you don''t care who is watching your kids. Isn''t that the same for FB, Instgram etc? I''m so worried that the kids are worried. It''s really worrying right now. The ""TikTok poses threat to democracy. And here''s why"" article can''t be far away now. Chinese spyware innit Another app which is diverting minds mainly the young to a useless life of exsistance with no real benefit to society except again making a few wealthy and gathering tons of data on individuals. In a crisis like this a change is needed to focus minds to things that matter, to change the future direction of the world we live in. yeah but it''s really really really harmless fun and it makes me feel good and able to cope with this whole thing. I mean it''s not drugs or alcohol, and I do break up my 6 hour TikTok hole with a brisk walk every now and then What makes you think drugs or alcohol are more harmful than 6 hours of TikTok? Seems like TikTok is mind destroying. Makes a Twitter look like an intellectual paradise in comparison :) Weird, wasnâ€™t TikTok the one we were being warned was an Iranian govt spy platform or something like that? Maybe Iâ€™m too old to understand TikTok, but I found every single video I watched on there terrible to almost mediocre without exception. Im 63 and I do find Tik Tok very addictive a lot of silliness and narcism plenty of eye candy. If your not interested just swipe next. Tik Tok though is very useful to know what people are thinking. Users are very supportive of people with disabilities. The Bullied. People with different views. It has the potential to be a great social movement which frankly has surprised me. you sure.

TikTok it''s one of the worst things ever create this century. It''s just a base of stupidities which increases the addiction of the young person to their phones .. I feel so sad when I hear that this app can bring people closer, it''s the exact opposite the people who live in the TikTok world accord more importance to a video of a random guy doing nothing with added value instead to go out with their friends drink a beer and share a real conversation .. It''s like the influencers, do you find that to be normal to have some people paid to just do cramming on you ... I think TikTok is helping a lot of people to face the quarantine due to the coronavirus crisis. It''s good thing, because people can connect to each others, in a funny way. It''s not like instagram or twitter, you don''t have to show a perfect image of yourself on the social media. Like they said on this article, TikTok is only about jokes, weird videos... <br>Thank you for writing an article which it''s describing TikTok in a good way ! Before this crisis, I wasn''t interested in this application. I was only watching videos posted via another social network (like Instagram). I think this app helps people to mentally endure this situation. I find it cool, it allows them to escape. Users can create content and develop their imaginations. They can also be just spectators. Personally, I''m only a spectator and I could spend hours on my phone. It entertains me, makes me laugh.
